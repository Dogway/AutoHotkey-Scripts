## Fix Windows 7 - AHK Script

AutoHotkey script to put Windows 7 under control and optimize UX workflow.

I also recommend to use this along AltDrag and 7+TaskbarTweaker, and obviously ClassicShell.

**File Explorer**
*   Disable Ctrl+W to avoid Explorer closing by mistake
*   Disable file deletion with Ctrl+D, Undo with Ctr+Z and F1 (help)

*   F3 for New Folder
*   Ctrl+F for Search (With FileSearchEX)
*   Ctrl+I for Invert Selection
*   Alt+D for Detail View
*   Alt+V for Thumbnail View


**General**
*   Disable Capslock
*   Disable Ctrl+Wheel (Resize Icons) when on Desktop
*   Disable Alt+F4 (Shutdown) when taskbar is in focus
*   Disable Alt+Shift (taskbar language switch) while in Photoshop and Blender
*   Disable Win+F (Windows Search)
*   Alt+T for Always on Top on Active Window
